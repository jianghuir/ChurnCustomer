<h1>Factors that lead to the customer's churning probability:</h1>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">f(x) value is the predicted churning probability of the customer, ranging from 0.0-1.0<br>
    For example, with f(x) 0.10, the customer is predicted to have a churning probability of 10%<br>
    Red blocks are factors leading to a higher churning probability<br>
    Blue blocks are factors leading to a lower churning probability<br>
    A bigger block poses a higher influence on churning probability
